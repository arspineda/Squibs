Reading original literature in syntactic theory can be difficult. The original
literature by now spans more than 60 years. As mentioned in the Introduction, this
field is very young, progress has been and continues to be rapid. In this time span,
many discoveries have been made, sometimes making earlier work obsolete, new
notations are constantly introduced to encode new understanding, making earlier
notations opaque. At the moving frontiers of knowledge, several hypotheses,
incompatible with each other, were and are simultaneously entertained. All this
contributes to making reading the original literature difficult.... As part of
language, the meaning of words sometimes shifts, and technical vocabulary or
notation evolves.
